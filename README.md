The steps are usually:

1. Getting the speaker profile and image
2. Generate the poster
3. Make the write-up
4. Post it in our Telegram, Facebook, Instagram
5. Sending emails for further marketing channels
6. \*Share the post to specific Facebook groups

It will usually take up much time for each step: because I am lazy!

So... let's automate it!
